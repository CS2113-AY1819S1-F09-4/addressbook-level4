<p>This Project Portfolio documents my role and contributions to this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RecruitBook is a project created for my core module [CS2113T Software Engineering] in my second year in
National University of Singapore(NUS). My team consists of 5 members, with a mixture of undergraduates majoring in Computer Engineering
and undergraduates majoring in Information Security. Throughout this 13-week long project, we were required to constantly
work on building the application while documenting on our progress and milestones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project requirement was to morph an AddressBook application into something that responds to social needs and
offers sustainable solutions. My team morphed it into a RecruitBook application to address the limited tools of
the HumanResource(HR) departments and various free-lance job agents. Our application provides a sustainable solution
as it eliminates the need for paperwork and application forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RecruitBook is an offline desktop application that allows you to manage candidates and job offers
throughout the process of recruiting. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement: added a Shortlist feature</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: It allows the user to shortlist a candidate for a selected job offer of a selected company.
It also allows the user to delete a shortlisted candidate from a selected job offer of a selected company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user can link up the potential candidates to
suitable job offers. It makes the recruitment process easier because a user can be easily confused by the high volume of jobs
and candidates. Furthermore, this feature allows a shortlisted candidate to be deleted in case the user changes his/her mind.
Overall, it emphasises on the selling point of RecruitBook as it is built to improve the way shortlisting process is carried out in the recruitment process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This feature is unlike other 1-step commands as it carries out a series of commands linked together like a shortlisting
process. It required user to select a company, then select a job offered by that company, then select a candidate to be
shortlisted for that job. The shortlisting process takes up 5 stages, while the deleting process takes up 4 stages.
Moreover, this enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives as to how the shortlisted candidates are stored and displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: Used Nicholas&#8217;s idea of LogicState to carry out the multi-staged process of this feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement: redesigned the User Interface(UI) to suit RecruitBook</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: It allows the user to switch view between Candidate Book and Company Book, as well as interact with the items
displayed on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature is essential in the product as it manages the data of both candidates and companies.
In order to benefit the user, the app should organise the way data is displayed to the user. Overall, it emphasises on the selling point
of RecruitBook as it is built to improve the way data is handled in the recruitment process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required a lot of research on JavaFX
as I was new to Java and JavaFX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: Existing examples from how the GUI was implemented in <a href="https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4">AddressBook</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select feature is extended to 3 different commands: select company, select job and select candidate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List feature is extended to list candidates, and list companies and job offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StatusFooterBar at the bottom of the application keeps track of the total number of candidates and companies,
as well as their last updated time and locations of the files saved.</p>
