<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RecruitBook is a project created for CS2113T, Object Oriented Programming and Software Engineering, in the first semester of the second year of my undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore. It was created with reference from <a href="https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/">SE-EDU&#8217;s AddressBook 4</a> in a group of 5 using GitHub as our collaboration medium.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project involved turning the AddressBook application into RecruitBook, an application which aids Job Agents find suitable candidates for companies and vice versa.
My role in this project was to develop the email feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from simply developing the software, I have picked up many hard skills from working on this project such as using proper coding standards, using continuous integrations, writing tests, using JavaFX, and many software engineering principles
such as the Law of Demeter and Brooks' Law.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have also picked up soft skills while working with my team such as using the "I message" to get my points across without sounding rude,
meeting skills to include everybody in the discussion so as to get everybody&#8217;s input to prevent future misunderstandings,
and when conflicts arise, conflict resolution skills where I have to be careful in my choice of words
so as to solve the conflict professionally, while mitigating damage where possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RecruitBook is a desktop application created for job agents. The user interacts with it using a command line interface, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10,000 lines of code.<br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Added an email feature</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Allows the user to mass send emails about job offers to multiple candidates or about candidates to multiple companies regarding specified job offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: It is imperative for a job agent to be able to inform candidates about job offers or inform companies about candidates. This feature allows emails to be sent quickly and automatically without any hassles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The email will be automatically generated, all the user needs to do is select the recipients and contents of the email. There is a preview feature built into the command to allow the user to double check the recipients and contents of the email. Subject text and body text of the email is also customisable.</p>

<p>The email command is facilitated by <code>EmailInitialiseCommand</code>, <code>EmailRecipientsCommand</code>, <code>EmailContentsCommand</code> and <code>EmailSendCommand</code>
classes which extends the <code>Command</code> class, and <code>EmailUtil</code> attribute in <code>Model</code> which stores variables and methods pertaining to the email command
and the <code>EmailSettings</code> class which stores email subject and email body text settings.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, the email command is quite complicated, so in order to explain how it works, given below is an example usage scenario of how the email command behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>You launch the application. The application loads email settings from <code>preferences.json</code> which is stored in <code>Model#EmailUtil</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You execute the <code>email</code> command. A new <code>EmailUtil</code> object is constructed and replaces the <code>EmailUtil</code> object in <code>Model</code>
using <code>model#resetEmailUtil</code>. <code>LogicState</code> is changed to reflect initialisation of the email command, moving the <code>LogicState</code> to recipients selection state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You use <code>listc</code>, <code>findc</code>, <code>filterc</code>, <code>listC</code>, <code>findC</code>, <code>findj</code>, <code>filterC</code> and <code>filterj</code> to filter out who you wish to send the email to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You execute the <code>add</code> command for the first time. This calls <code>EmailRecipientsAddCommand</code>.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>The add command first checks if there are recipients to add with <code>EmailRecipientsAddCommand#addCandidates or #addJobOffers</code>. If there is nothing to add, an error message will be displayed. If there are objects to add, then the following steps will be executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>EmailUtil#hasRecipientsAdded</code> boolean value is changed to true to indicate that there are recipients added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MainWindow#getCurrentBook()</code> is called to return which book you are on and <code>EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code> boolean value is changed accordingly:</p>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i">
<li>
<p>If recipients are candidates, <code>EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code> will be true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If recipients are companies, <code>EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code> will be false.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on <code>EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code>, the recipient objects are called with <code>Model#getFilteredCandidateList</code> or <code>Model#getFilteredJobList</code> and are stored in a linked hash set within <code>EmailUtil</code> to prevent duplicates and to preserve insertion order.<br>
Using the <code>LinkedHashSet#add()</code> boolean return value, it is possible to determine if object added is a duplicate. Duplicates are not added and are noted down inside an <code>ArrayList</code> within <code>EmailRecipientsAddCommand</code> which will be reflected back to the user.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You then use <code>listc</code>, <code>findc</code> and <code>filterc</code> or <code>listC</code>, <code>findC</code>, <code>findj</code>, <code>filterC</code> and <code>filterj</code> to filter out more recipients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You execute another <code>add</code> command to add more recipients. This calls <code>EmailRecipientsAddCommand</code></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If <code>MainWindow#getCurrentBook()</code> and <code>EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code> do not match, for example, if <code>MainWindow#getCurrentBook()</code> returns <code>companyBook</code>, and <code>emailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code> is <code>true</code>, you will be notified with an error message because you have already added candidates as recipients, and you should not be allowed to add job offers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <code>MainWindow#getCurrentBook()</code> and <code>EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code> match, recipients are added as per normal, as seen above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are duplicate recipients, RecruitBook will inform you about them and they will not be added.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have added your recipients. So now you wish to move on to the next step, so you execute the <code>next</code> command. This calls <code>EmailRecipientsNextCommand</code> which based on <code>EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code>, which switches the current book and changes <code>LogicState</code> to select contents phase.</p>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
In <code>EmailContentSelectionCommand</code> phase, depending on <code>EmailUtil#areRecipientsCandidates</code>, the book displayed will be locked and only
commands pertaining to the current book can be used. This is to enforce that recipients and contents are either candidates and job offers or job offers and candidates.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You use <code>listc</code>, <code>findc</code> and <code>filterc</code> or <code>listC</code>, <code>findC</code>, <code>findj</code>, <code>filterC</code> and <code>filterj</code> to filter out the contents of the email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You then execute the <code>add</code> command. This calls <code>EmailContentsAddCommand</code> which adds contents in the same manner as <code>EmailRecipientsAddCommand</code> as seen above. Having no contents to be added and duplicates will be caught and reflected back to you in the form of an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You execute <code>next</code> command to move on to the confirmation step. This calls <code>EmailContentsNextCommand</code> which changes <code>LogicState</code> to the send phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to double check if you have picked the correct recipients and contents, you execute the <code>preview</code> command. This calls <code>EmailSendPreviewCommand</code>.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>This generates a string of the email based on recipients and contents in <code>EmailUtil</code> which calls <code>EventCenter</code> to post <code>ShowEmailPreviewEvent</code> with the email String and shows the string in a new window, <code>EmailPreview</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The string is generated differently, depending if your recipients are candidates or companies.</p>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i">
<li>
<p>If your recipients are candidates, then the <code>To</code> field of the email will contain all the recipients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your recipients are job offers, then the job offers are paired with its company, and each company will have its own <code>To</code> field, to show that an email will be sent individually to each company.<br>
For example, if I am sending an email to <code>Apple</code> regarding a job offer on <code>Cashier</code> and <code>Cleaner</code>, and <code>DBS</code> regarding a job offer on <code>Cafe Waiter</code>, there will be 2 <code>To</code> fields that look like this:</p>
<div class="olist upperalpha">
<ol class="upperalpha" type="A">
<li>
<p><code>To: Apple(<a href="mailto:apple@example.com">apple@example.com</a>) regarding job offers: [Cashier, Cleaner]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>To: DBS(<a href="mailto:dbs@example.com">dbs@example.com</a>) regarding job offer: [Cafe Waiter]</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are satisfied with the preview and execute the <code>send</code> command to send the email. This generates the email as a <code>MimeMessage</code> which is the Java format used for emails and is sent via <code>EmailUtil#sendMessage</code>.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If recipients are candidates, one email will be sent to all candidates with their emails sent under the <code>BCC</code> field to prevent recipients from seeing each other&#8217;s emails, which preserves privacy of the candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If recipients are companies, one email will be sent per company detailing the specific job offer(s) that you have added during the selection of recipients.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LogicState</code> is then reset back to original and this marks the end of the email command.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Having a pop up Email window with editable fields</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: More customisable, more intuitive and looks better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Very labour intensive to email many people. Adding candidates manually will take a very long time, even if the GUI can be used to assist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (current choice):</strong> Using command line to mass add recipients and contents</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Very suitable for mass sending applications, which was the main design consideration when designing the email command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Not very customisable, but we will try to add more customisability down the road.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PartyCards was a project created for CP2106, Independent Software Development Project (Orbital), during the summer after my first year in the National University of Singapore.
The project was created from scratch in a group of 2, using GitHub as our collaboration medium.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PartyCards was written with ReactJS frontend and Node.js backend. Being forced to write this web application from scratch gave me many insights into the world of website creation, from creating the back-end server to the front-end design of the website. I also learnt how to use the ReactJS javascript framework and use NodeJS effectively as the back end for the website, which is the preferred choice of frameworks to use for website-building nowadays.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PartyCards is a web application that allows up to 4 users play card games. Card games include: Cheat, Taiti, Bridge and Hearts.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Allows up to 4 users to connect and play the game: Cheat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: I wrote the logic of the game, from how the front end checks if a card being played is valid to how the back end handles if somebody is being accused as cheating.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Added game: Taiti</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Allows up to 4 users to connect and play the game: Taiti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: I wrote the logic of the game, from how the front end checks if a card combination being played is valid to how back end handles each turn and updates the current deck.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Reconnection feature</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Allows users to disconnect from the game instance and rejoin the game instance,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Users should be allowed to reconnect to a game should they disconnect due to bad internet connection.</p>
